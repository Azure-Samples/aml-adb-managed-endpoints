# Deploy models from Azure Databricks to Azure ML in a secure way - Solution Accelerator

In this repository we will see how to deploy real-time models connecting the Workspaces of Azure Databricks and Azure Machine Learning in a secure way.

As an example, we will use an already-trained Churn prediction model. The model was trained using the XGBoost algorithm and makes a binary prediction to predict Churn (YES/NO). The serialized model can be found in the [directory](churn-deploy/model/).

Below is a diagram demonstrating the deployment process:
